## 📌 Future Value (FV) — Time Value of Money

> “If I invest this money today, what will it be worth in the future, given a certain interest rate or return?”

---

### 🔍 Definition  
**Future Value (FV)** is the value of a sum of money at a specific point in the future, based on a given rate of return or interest rate.  
It reflects the **time value of money** — the idea that ₹1 today is worth more than ₹1 in the future because you can invest it and earn returns.

---

### 💡 Opportunity Cost Connection  
The **opportunity cost** is the return you forgo by not investing your money elsewhere.  
- If a bank offers **6% annual interest**, that 6% is your **opportunity cost of holding cash**.  
- FV calculations use this rate to determine how much your money could grow if invested at that rate.

---

### 📐 Formula (Annual Compounding)  
$$
FV = P \times (1 + r)^n
$$

Where:  
- **P** = Present value (starting amount)  
- **r** = Annual interest rate / return (decimal form)  
- **n** = Number of years

---

### 📅 Example — Using Opportunity Cost  
You have ₹1,00,000 today. A bank offers 6% annual interest. What is the FV in 5 years?  

1. \( 1 + r = 1.06 \)  
2. Raise to the power of n: \( 1.06^5 \approx 1.3382 \)  
3. Multiply by P: \( ₹1,00,000 \times 1.3382 \approx ₹1,33,820 \)  

If you don’t invest, you miss the opportunity to have **₹33,820 more** after 5 years.

---

### 📊 Example — Investment Returns  
If instead of 6%, you invest in something giving 12% annually:  

$$
FV = 1,00,000 \times (1.12)^5 \approx ₹1,76,234
$$

Your **opportunity cost** of choosing the 6% bank deposit over the 12% investment is:  

$$
₹1,76,234 - ₹1,33,820 = ₹42,414
$$

---

### 🔄 Relation to CAGR  
- **Future Value** projects forward: Given **P**, **r**, **n** → find **FV**.  
- **CAGR** works backward: Given **P**, **FV**, **n** → find **r**.  

Formulas:  

$$
FV = P \times (1 + r)^n
$$  

$$
r = \left( \frac{FV}{P} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
$$
