>"If my investment grew steadily at the same rate every year, what annual rate would take me from my starting value to my ending value over the given time?"

## Definition
CAGR represents the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified time period, assuming profits are reinvested each year.

## Formula
```
CAGR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / t)] - 1
```
- **t** = Number of years

## Formula Example
- Beginning Value: â‚¹100,000
- Ending Value: â‚¹125,000
- Time: 3 years
```
CAGR = (125,000 / 100,000)^(1/3) - 1
CAGR = 0.0772 â†’ 7.72% per year
```

## Real life example

suppose if i have 1lakh in hand and in 4 years get the return of 2lakh.
with the CAGR formula, i get **18.92071150027210667174999705605%**. which means every year compounded at 18.9%

### ðŸ“… Year-by-Year Growth Table

|Year|Start Amount|Growth @ r%|End Amount|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|â‚¹1,00,000|â‚¹18,920|â‚¹1,18,920|
|2|â‚¹1,18,920|â‚¹22,479.66|â‚¹1,41,399.66|
|3|â‚¹1,41,399.66|â‚¹26,727.06|â‚¹1,68,126.72|
|4|â‚¹1,68,126.72|â‚¹31,833.07|â‚¹1,99,959.79|
## Pros
- Accounts for compounding.
- Allows comparison across different time periods.
