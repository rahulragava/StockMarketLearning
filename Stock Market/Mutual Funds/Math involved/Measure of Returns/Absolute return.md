# Absolute Return

## Definition
Absolute Return is the total percentage gain or loss of an investment over the entire holding period, without considering the time it took to achieve it.

## Formula
```
Absolute Return (%) = ((Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value) × 100
```

## Example
- Beginning Value: ₹100,000
- Ending Value: ₹125,000
```
((125,000 - 100,000) / 100,000) × 100 = 25%
```
Result: **25%**

## Pros
- Easy to calculate.
- Shows overall profit or loss.

## Cons / Limitations
- Ignores time — a 25% return in 1 year is very different from 25% in 5 years.
