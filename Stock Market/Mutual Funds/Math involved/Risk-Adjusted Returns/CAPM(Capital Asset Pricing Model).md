# 📌 CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)

## 🔹 Definition
The **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** estimates the **expected return** of an investment based on its risk relative to the overall market.  


Alpha calculate panna idha use panna correct ah iruku. rather than just using benchmark since risk should be involved.

It helps investors answer:  
👉 *“Given the risk of this stock/fund, how much return should I expect compared to a risk-free investment?”*

## 🔹 Formula

$$
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i \times (R_m - R_f)
$$

Where:  
- **\(E(R_i)\)** = Expected return of stock/fund *i*  
- **\(R_f\)** = Risk-free rate (e.g., government bond return)  
- **\(\beta_i\)** = Beta of the stock/fund (sensitivity to market moves)  
- **\(R_m\)** = Expected market return (benchmark index like Nifty 50, Sensex, S&P 500)  
- **\((R_m - R_f)\)** = Market Risk Premium (extra reward for taking risk beyond risk-free asset)  

---

## 🔹 Intuition
- If **Beta = 1** → Stock moves same as the market → Expected return = Market return.  
- If **Beta > 1** → Stock is riskier (more volatile) → Investors demand higher returns.  
- If **Beta < 1** → Stock is safer (less volatile) → Expected return is lower.  

---

## 🔹 Example
- Risk-free rate \(R_f = 5\%\)  
- Market return \(R_m = 10\%\)  
- Stock Beta = 1.2  

$$
E(R) = 5\% + 1.2 \times (10\% - 5\%)
$$  

$$
E(R) = 5\% + 6\% = 11\%
$$  

✅ **Expected return = 11%**  

- If actual return = 15% → **Alpha = +4%** (outperformance).  
- If actual return = 8% → **Alpha = -3%** (underperformance).

CAPM says:  
👉 *“Based on your batting risk, you should score 180 runs.”*  
- If you actually score 200 → **Alpha +20 (outperformance)**.  
- If you score 160 → **underperformance given your risk**.
