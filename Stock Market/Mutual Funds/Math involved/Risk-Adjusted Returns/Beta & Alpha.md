# Understanding Beta and Alpha in Investing

---

## What is Beta?

- **Beta** measures how much a stock or investment moves compared to the overall stock market.
- It tells you the **risk or volatility** of an investment relative to the whole market.
- The market’s beta is always **1.0** by definition.
>Higher the beta value higher the risk/reward

### What Different Values of Beta Mean:

>If a stock has a beta of 1.5, it means the stock is **50% more volatile than the overall market**. Here's what that implies:

| Beta Value   | Meaning                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Beta = 1** | The stock moves *with* the market. If the market goes up 5%, the stock likely goes up 5%.                                                                             |
| **Beta > 1** | The stock is *more volatile* than the market. If beta is 1.5, and market goes up 10%, stock might go up 15%. likewise if market goes down 10% stock might go down 15% |
| **Beta < 1** | The stock is *less volatile* than the market. If beta is 0.5, and market goes up 10%, stock might go up 5%. Safer but possibly lower returns.                         |
| **Beta < 0** | The stock moves *opposite* to the market. If market goes up 10%, stock may go down (rare).                                                                            |

### Why is Beta Important?

- Helps investors understand **how risky** a stock is compared to the market.
- Investors use beta to select stocks matching their **risk tolerance**.
- Used in the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** to calculate expected returns based on risk.

## What is Alpha?

- **Alpha** measures the **performance** of an investment *compared to* a benchmark (like the market).
- It tells you if the investment did **better or worse** than expected given its risk level (beta).

### Key Points on Alpha:

- **Positive alpha** (e.g., +2%) means the investment *outperformed* the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
- **Negative alpha** (e.g., -1%) means the investment *underperformed* the market.
- Alpha shows the **extra value a fund manager adds** through skill, beyond market returns.

## Simple Illustration

- Suppose a stock has a beta of 1.2 (20% more volatile than the market).
- The market returned 10% this year.
- Using [[CAPM(Capital Asset Pricing Model)]], the expected return for this stock might be 12% (because of higher risk).
- If the stock actually returned 15%, the **alpha is +3%** — better than expected.
- If it returned 10%, the alpha is -2% — it underperformed given its risk.

## Summary Table

| Term   | What it Measures                               | What it Tells You                         |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Beta**  | Volatility or risk relative to the market     | How much a stock moves compared to market|
| **Alpha** | Performance versus what is expected based on risk | How much a stock outperforms or underperforms |
