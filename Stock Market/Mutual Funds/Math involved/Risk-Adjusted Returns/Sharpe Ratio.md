## üìå Sharpe Ratio #ReturnByRisk

> "How much extra return am I getting for the risk I‚Äôm taking?" ‚Äî Measures reward per unit of risk.

---

### **üîç Simple Meaning**
- The Sharpe Ratio tells you **if an investment‚Äôs return is worth the risk** you took to get it.  
- **Higher Sharpe Ratio** ‚Üí Better risk-adjusted performance.  
- **Lower Sharpe Ratio** ‚Üí The return may not justify the risk.

### **üìå What is Volatility?**

>"How wildly the returns move over time."  
 
 Volatility measures how much an investment‚Äôs price or returns **fluctuate** ‚Äî up or down ‚Äî compared to its average.  
- **High volatility** ‚Üí Big swings in returns ‚Üí More uncertainty and risk.  
- **Low volatility** ‚Üí Smaller, steadier movements ‚Üí More predictable returns.

In Sharpe Ratio, volatility is measured using **standard deviation (œÉ)**.
### **üéØ Example**
If two funds both give **10% returns**:  
- Fund A has low #volatility (œÉ = 5%) ‚Üí Higher Sharpe Ratio ‚Üí Better.  
- Fund B has high volatility (œÉ = 15%) ‚Üí Lower Sharpe Ratio ‚Üí Riskier for the same return.

### **üìå Formula**
$$
Sharpe\ Ratio = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
$$

Where:  
- \( R_p \) = Portfolio return  
- \( R_f \) = Risk-free return (e.g., government bond yield)  
- \( \sigma_p \) = Standard deviation of portfolio returns

### **üí° Thumb Rule**
- **> 1.0** ‚Üí Good  
- **> 2.0** ‚Üí Very Good  
- **> 3.0** ‚Üí Excellent

### **The Problem** #SharpeProblem

- From an investor‚Äôs point of view:
    
    - **Big downward swings** ‚Üí Bad risk.
        
    - **Big upward swings** ‚Üí Usually a _good thing_.
        
- But to Sharpe Ratio, both are just ‚Äúdeviation‚Äù and are treated equally as _risk_.
    
- This means investments with large upside spikes (e.g., tech stocks, startups, crypto) can get a **lower Sharpe Ratio** even if the volatility is mostly positive.
