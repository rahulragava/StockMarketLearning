# Equity Mutual Fund

## Definition
An **Equity Mutual Fund** is a type of mutual fund that primarily invests in **stocks (equities)** of companies.  
By pooling money from many investors, the fund buys shares of multiple companies, giving investors **diversification** and **professional management**.

---

## Key Features
- **High Growth Potential**: Since equities generally outperform other asset classes in the long run.  
- **Higher Risk**: Stock prices are volatile, so short-term fluctuations are common.  
- **Diversification**: Exposure to multiple companies and sectors reduces individual stock risk.  
- **Long-Term Focus**: Best suited for long-term wealth creation (5+ years).

## Types of Equity Mutual Funds
1. **Large Cap Funds**  
   - Invest in top 100 companies by market capitalization.  
   - Relatively stable with moderate returns.  

2. **Mid Cap Funds**  
   - Invest in 101–250th ranked companies by market capitalization.  
   - Higher growth potential, but also higher risk.  

3. **Small Cap Funds**  
   - Invest beyond the top 250 companies.  
   - Very high risk but can generate high returns.  

4. **Multi Cap Funds**  
   - Invest across large, mid, and small caps.  

5. **Sectoral/Thematic Funds**  
   - Focused on a specific sector (e.g., IT, Pharma).  
   - Risky due to lack of diversification.

## Example
Suppose you invest ₹1,00,000 in an **Equity Mutual Fund** with annual return of 12% (average).  

After 10 years:  

$$
FV = PV \times (1 + r)^{n}
$$  

Where:  
- \(PV = 100000\) (present value / initial investment)  
- \(r = 0.12\) (annual return)  
- \(n = 10\) years  

So,  

$$
FV = 100000 \times (1 + 0.12)^{10}
$$  

$$
FV = ₹3,10,585
$$  

Your money grows **3x** in a decade (ignoring taxes & expenses).

## Risks
- **Market Risk**: Linked to stock market ups and downs.  
- **Sector Risk**: Over-concentration in one sector.  
- **Liquidity Risk**: Sometimes funds may not find buyers quickly for stocks.  

---

## Who Should Invest?
- Investors with a **long-term horizon (5+ years)**.  
- People looking for **higher returns** and willing to take **moderate to high risk**.  
- Suitable for goals like **retirement corpus, wealth creation, children’s education**.
