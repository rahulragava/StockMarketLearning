# Expense Ratio

## Definition
The **Expense Ratio** is the annual fee charged by a mutual fund to manage your money.  
It is expressed as a percentage of the fund‚Äôs **Assets Under Management (AUM)**.  

üëâ It includes:  
- Fund management fee (salary to fund managers & analysts)  
- Administrative expenses  
- Marketing & distribution costs  
- GST (on fees)  

---

## Formula
$$
\text{Expense Ratio (\%)} = \frac{\text{Total Expenses of the Fund}}{\text{Average Assets Under Management (AUM)}} \times 100
$$

---

## Example
Suppose a mutual fund has:  
- **AUM** = ‚Çπ1,000 crore  
- **Expenses** = ‚Çπ5 crore  

$$
\text{Expense Ratio} = \frac{5}{1000} \times 100 = 0.5\%
$$  

That means for every ‚Çπ1,00,000 you invest, **‚Çπ500 is deducted annually** as expenses.

## Why It Matters
- A **higher expense ratio** reduces your returns.  
- Over long-term, even **0.5% difference** compounds into lakhs of rupees.  
- **Direct Plans** have lower expense ratios than **Regular Plans**.

## Types
1. **TER (Total Expense Ratio)**  
   - Covers all recurring expenses charged to the scheme.  

2. **Additional Expense Charges**  
   - SEBI allows a few extra expenses (like distribution costs).  

---

## SEBI Regulation (India)
- For equity funds: capped at around **2.25%** (declining with AUM size).  
- For debt funds: usually lower (**0.5%‚Äì1%**).

## Impact Over Time
Example with ‚Çπ10,00,000 investment, annual return of 12% for 20 years:  

| Expense Ratio | Final Corpus |
|---------------|--------------|
| 1.5%          | ‚Çπ74.6 lakh   |
| 0.5%          | ‚Çπ91.9 lakh   |

‚ö° Difference = **‚Çπ17.3 lakh lost** just due to expenses!
