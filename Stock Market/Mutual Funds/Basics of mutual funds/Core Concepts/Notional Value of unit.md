## üîç What is a Notional Unit?

- When a mutual fund scheme is launched, its units do not have a market-determined NAV yet.
- To start, the fund assigns a **notional value** (also called face value or par value) to each unit, often ‚Çπ10 or ‚Çπ100.
- This notional value acts as a baseline or reference for the first NAV calculation.
- Investors initially buy these units at the notional value when investing in the new fund.

## üìå How Are Notional Units Allotted?

1. **Launch of the Fund:**
   - At the start, the fund creates units with a fixed notional value (say ‚Çπ10 per unit).
2. **Investor Subscription:**
   - When investors invest money, the number of units allotted is calculated by dividing the investment amount by the notional value.
   
   For example:  
   Investment amount = ‚Çπ50,000  
   Notional value per unit = ‚Çπ10  
   Units allotted = $$\frac{50,000}{10} = 5,000 units$$  

3. **Post-Launch NAV Calculation:**
   - After the fund begins investing in securities, the NAV is calculated daily based on actual market values.
   - From this point on, units are bought and sold based on NAV, which fluctuates with the market.

## üí° Why Are Notional Units Used?

- It provides a **starting price** for the fund‚Äôs units before market instruments are purchased.
- Helps in calculating **exact units allotted** to investors for their initial investment.
- Gives a clear basis for tracking growth since launch.

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Fund Launch          | Units assigned notional value ‚Çπ10/unit    |
| Investor invests ‚Çπ1,00,000 | Units allotted = \( \frac{1,00,000}{10} = 10,000 \) units |
| Fund invests money   | Buys stocks, bonds, etc.                   |
| Next NAV calculation | NAV reflects market value of invested assets, may rise above ‚Çπ10 or fall below |
