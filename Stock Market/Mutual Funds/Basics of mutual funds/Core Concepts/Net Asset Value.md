## 🔍 What is Net Asset Value (NAV)?

- **Net Asset Value (NAV)** tells you the value of a single unit (sometimes called a 'share') of a mutual fund on a given day.
- When you invest in mutual funds, you buy “units” at the day’s NAV.
- NAV changes daily as the value of the fund’s investments goes up or down.

---

## 📌 Why Does NAV Matter?

- **When you invest:** Determines how many units you get for your money.
  - Example: Investing ₹2,000 at NAV = ₹20/unit gives you 100 units.
- **When you sell (redeem):** NAV tells you what your units are worth.
  - If you sell 100 units at NAV = ₹25/unit, you’ll get ₹2,500.

## 🧮 How is NAV Calculated? (The Formula)

Think of NAV as the price tag on a “basket” containing all the fund’s investments.

$$
\text{NAV} = \frac{\text{(Total Assets - Total Liabilities)}}{\text{Number of Units Outstanding}}
$$

- **Total Assets:** All stocks, bonds, cash, and other things the fund owns (at current market prices).
- **Total Liabilities:** All money the fund owes (expenses, fees, etc.).
- **Units Outstanding:** Total number of fund units investors hold.

---

### 💡 Simple Example

Let’s say a fund has:
- Total assets: ₹10,00,000 (all investments combined)
- Total liabilities: ₹50,000 (expenses, fees, etc.)
- Units outstanding: 95,000

**NAV Calculation:**

$$ \text{NAV} = \frac{10,00,000 - 50,000}{95,000} = \frac{9,50,000}{95,000} = 10 $$

So, each unit of the fund is worth **₹10** today.

## 📊 Example: Tracking Fund Investment Value and Profit

Consider a mutual fund that invests in 10 different stocks. Each stock starts with an investment value of ₹27,500, making the total initial investment ₹2,75,000.

## 💰 Calculating Profit and Percentage Return

From the above table:

- Total Investment Value on Day 1 = ₹2,75,000  
- Total Value on Day 2 = ₹2,77,844  

### Profit earned:

$$ Profit = ₹2,77,844 - ₹2,75,000 = ₹2,844 $$

### Percentage Return on Investment:

Return % = (₹2,844 / ₹2,75,000) * 100 = 1.034%

means in day2, NAV is 10* (1 + 1.034) = ₹10.1034 (actual nav also takes expense ratio and fund expense into consideration)

---

This example helps you understand how the NAV of a fund changes as the value of underlying investments change, and how the profit and percentage return are calculated on your total invested amount.

## 📅 How Often is NAV Calculated?

- Mutual fund NAV is **updated at the end of every trading day** (after the market closes).
- The new NAV reflects all gains/losses for that day.

---

## 📝 Key Points for Beginners

- **Lower or higher NAV doesn’t mean a better or worse fund.** It just shows the current unit price.
- When you invest (say, ₹1,000), you get units based on the current NAV – more if the NAV is low, fewer if it’s high, but the value remains the same.
- **NAV goes up** if the fund’s investments increase in value and after expenses.
- Transaction costs and expenses (like the expense ratio) are reflected in NAV every day.

## 🙋 Common Questions

**Q:** Is a fund with NAV ₹10 “cheaper” than one with NAV ₹250?  
**A:** Not necessarily! Both could give the same returns. Focus on fund performance, not just NAV.

**Q:** Does a higher NAV mean higher returns?  
**A:** No. Returns depend on how well the investments inside the fund have done, not the NAV number itself.
