# Deflation

## Definition
Deflation is the sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time.  
It increases the purchasing power of money, meaning the same amount of money buys more goods and services.

## Formula
**Basic Deflation Rate Calculation:**
```
Deflation Rate (%) = ((CPI_previous - CPI_current) / CPI_previous) × 100
```
- **CPI** = Consumer Price Index.

---

## Example
- CPI in 2024: 180  
- CPI in 2025: 175  
```
Deflation Rate = ((180 - 175) / 180) × 100  
Deflation Rate = (5 / 180) × 100 = 2.78%
```
Result: **2.78% annual deflation**.

---

## Causes
- Fall in aggregate demand (consumers spend less).
- Overproduction of goods and services.
- Tight monetary policy or reduced money supply.
- Technological advancements increasing productivity (mild deflation).

---

## Effects
**Positive:**
- Increases purchasing power.
- Beneficial for consumers in the short term.

**Negative:**
- May signal economic slowdown.
- Can increase real debt burden (harder to repay loans).
- Discourages spending and investment (expectation of lower prices later).

---

## Types of Deflation
1. **Good Deflation** – Caused by productivity improvements and technological advances, lowering costs.
2. **Bad Deflation** – Caused by economic downturn, falling demand, and rising unemployment.

---

## Measuring Deflation
- Same as inflation, usually via **CPI**, **WPI**, or **GDP Deflator**, but values are negative.

---

## Deflation & Investing
- Deflation increases the real value of money but can hurt asset prices.
- Investors often prefer safer assets (e.g., bonds, cash) during deflationary periods.
