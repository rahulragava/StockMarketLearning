# Inflation

## Definition
Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, resulting in a decrease in purchasing power of money.  
In simpler terms: over time, the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services.

## Formula
**Basic Inflation Rate Calculation:**
```
Inflation Rate (%) = ((CPI_current - CPI_previous) / CPI_previous) × 100
```
- **CPI** = Consumer Price Index (a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers).

---

## Example
- CPI in 2024: 180  
- CPI in 2025: 190  
```
Inflation Rate = ((190 - 180) / 180) × 100  
Inflation Rate = (10 / 180) × 100 = 5.56%
```
Result: **5.56% annual inflation**.

## Types of Inflation
1. **Demand-Pull Inflation** – Prices rise when demand exceeds supply.
2. **Cost-Push Inflation** – Prices rise due to increased production costs.
3. **Built-In Inflation** – Prices rise due to wage-price spiral.
4. **Hyperinflation** – Extremely high inflation (often >50% per month).
5. **Stagflation** – Inflation + stagnant economic growth + high unemployment.

---

## Causes
- Increase in demand for goods/services.
- Increase in production costs (wages, raw materials).
- Excessive money supply growth.
- Supply chain disruptions.

---

## Effects
**Positive:**
- Encourages spending and investment (if moderate).
- Reduces real value of debt.

**Negative:**
- Erodes purchasing power.
- Uncertainty in business planning.
- May reduce savings value.

## Measuring Inflation
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** – Focuses on retail prices of a basket of goods.
- **Wholesale Price Index (WPI)** – Measures price changes at the wholesale level.
- **GDP Deflator** – Measures price changes for all goods and services in an economy.

## Inflation & Investing
- **Nominal Return** = Raw return from an investment.
- **Real Return** = Nominal Return − Inflation Rate.
- Example: If a portfolio earns 8% and inflation is 6%, the real return is 2%.
